# NumPy Zero and NumPy Plot

This README provides an overview of two important concepts in the NumPy library: `np.zero` and `np.plot`. NumPy is a powerful Python library for numerical and scientific computing.

## `np.zero`

### Description

`np.zero` is not a built-in NumPy function, but it's often used to create arrays filled with zeros. The correct NumPy function for this purpose is `numpy.zeros()`. This function creates an array of specified shape and fills it with zeros.

### Usage

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array of zeros with 5 elements
zeros_1d = np.zeros(5)
print(zeros_1d)

# Create a 2D array of zeros with a shape of (3, 4)
zeros_2d = np.zeros((3, 4))
print(zeros_2d)
